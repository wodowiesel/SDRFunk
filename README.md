## SDRFunk Radio Receiver Chrome Extension 1.1.6_0 experimental

This is an enhanced version of the original extention

by wodowiesel

**Experimental !**

### Acknowledgements:

based on Google Radio Receiver 1.1.5_0 (for Chrome =< 70)

Chrome Extension Scripts by Jacobo Tarrio from 30. Juni 2016

Chrome Store [Radio-Receiver](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/radio-receiver/miieomcelenidlleokajkghmifldohpo)

[Git-Link](https://github.com/google/radioreceiver) user: jtarrio under Apache License v2.0

Tested with Chrome v73.0.3683.86 official x64-bit (Browserversion 88 >= 71) with manifest v2

(Browserversion 88+) with manifest v3 wip

___

### Info:

Receive and listen to FM, AM, SSB radio broadcasts on your browser using an RTL-SDR (RTL2832U-demodulator-chip) USB digital (TV) tuner.

This application does FM, AM, SSB demodulation in the browser and can capture the radio signals as .wav

* This version was improved with adjustable styles, window-sizes and better permission controls

* Supports most compatible R820T & T2 tuner IC chips now (maybe some E4000 !?)

See PIDs & VIDs & Names in the [Compatibility-List](docs/compatibility-list.csv) (43 Devices incl. Generic now)

Features:

* Scanner-Function

* Recorder (.wav)

* Free-Tuning mode with Steps

* Supported modes: W-FM, N-FM, AM, SSB

* Shift-Correction - Up/Down-Converter needed!

___

### Preparations:

get this program via:

`git clone https://github.com/wodowiesel/SDRFunk`

or download the ZIP-File from the Release-Site (all included)

___

### Build & Install:

 For generating package just use the builder/packer in the extension manager of the browser.

a) Use the extention_1.1.6_0.crx (.pem for key) installer from the package

b) Unzip the extension and load it via Extension-Manager 'chrome://extensions' (in Experimental-Mode)

Path: `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions\APP-ID\1.1.6_0\`

('unsecure' warning because it's not directly from Google Store)

Permissions: Can be managed in the App-Details or in manifest

You can use _ locals if you want to, just remove the x in folder name (english/german).

JavaScript must be activated in your browser!

___

### Usage:

Run with admin/root permissions:

You can open the App via 'chrome://apps' and create a desktop short link via mouse right-click"

Use '. dot' as decimal-comma separator!

Radio works with .wav-file with 16-bit PCM @ 48000 [Hz] mono & stereo / 1 [kHz] - 12.000 [MHz] range.

- Tip: You could use just a copper wire for 2 m/70 cm-band or other lambda(1/4)-antennas (17.5 cm/6.9" in on PMR)

or any other antenna-configuration you like to use if you're an advanced amateur-radio-operator.

- You can use an LNA (USB 5 V or external) for improving signal-strength

- Bias-T (12 V vertical or 18 V horizontal on LNB as PLL-type) for satellites @ 10-12 [GHz] like Es-Hail.

- I use the [NooElec NESDR SMART](https://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-receivers/nesdr/nesdr-smart-sdr.html) with an LNA

 0.5 ppm, ultra-low Phase-noice TCXO / @ 1kHz Offset: -138 dBc/Hz / @ 10kHz: -150 dBc/Hz / @ 100kHz: -152 dBc/Hz

- You can use for HF/MF/LF/VLF/ULF also an [Upconverter](https://www.amazon.de/Ham-Plus-zusammengebaut-benutzerdefiniertem-Frequenzbereich/dp/B076CYK8XZ/ref=pd_sbs_23_4/261-1084655-6713527?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B076CYK8XZ&pd_rd_r=391428bd-af05-4e16-9e6d-e34dacb8f75b&pd_rd_w=IetOU&pd_rd_wg=UDmaE&pf_rd_p=74d946ea-18de-4443-bed6-d8837f922070&pf_rd_r=5E3NGBQXQGKN6E77P5BS&psc=1&refRID=5E3NGBQXQGKN6E77P5BS)

for Input-frequencies 100 kHz - 50 MHz to shift to Output 125.100 MHz - 175 MHz & intern TCXO works @125 MHz.

It's not specified for 10 kHz - 99.9 kHz but works ok.

### Warnings:

- Use only (original/tested) power supplies and cables

  (I use 2x ~5 V/500 mA via USB 2.0 for the LNA & SDR & USB-Wattmeter for monitoring)

- Antenna should be grounded if possible to avoid damage

- You can try a 1:X [Balun](https://www.amazon.de/NooElec-Balun-One-Nine-Applications/dp/B00R09WHT6/ref=pd_sbs_147_10?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00R09WHT6&pd_rd_r=d2cac03b-cede-4982-8814-be89ebc173f6&pd_rd_w=nPtSC&pd_rd_wg=E6ycZ&pf_rd_p=74d946ea-18de-4443-bed6-d8837f922070&pf_rd_r=S5SHDCX2JMVDNEKXMZ4D&psc=1&refRID=S5SHDCX2JMVDNEKXMZ4D) like 1:9 (to reduce internal resistance) if using long HF antenna for Short Wave

- Dummy-load: 0.1-100 W @ 50 Ohm "cement" or similar with cooling-ribs with fan for testing
